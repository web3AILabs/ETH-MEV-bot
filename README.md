# ETH-MEV-bot (Ethereum Mempool MEV BOT Uniswap 2 | Uniswap 3)

The MEV Bot tracks transactions on the selected decentralized exchange and finds among these transactions large orders 
that affect the liquidity in the pool and the price of the token. 

With an increased transaction fee, 
it makes a purchase of the same token slightly earlier and at a lower price. 
Once a large order goes into the blockchain. 
The price of the token in the liquidity pool increases. 
And immediately the MEV Bot sells the token at a profit. 
The bot earns 0.5-5% from each transaction on these MEV attacks. 
The bot can make up to 20 or more such deals per work cycle. In automatic mode and with minimal risk
